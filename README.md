# GoWiki
My work starting from wiki example from go docs (https://golang.org/doc/articles/wiki/) to whatever improvement comes to my mind.
I try to keep it iterated so readers can track improvements
**Iteration1:** Exactly the same code from the aforementioned example
**Iteration2:** Moved page data from text files to MongoDB database
**Iteration3:** List pages ordered by LastUpdate
