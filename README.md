# GoWiki
My work starting from wiki example from go docs (https://golang.org/doc/articles/wiki/) to whatever improvement comes to my mind.\
I try to keep it iterated so readers can track improvements\
**Iteration1:** Exactly the same code from the aforementioned example\
**Iteration2:** Moved page data from text files to MongoDB database\
**Iteration3:** Added a List page, listing all the entries in the database ordered by LastUpdate\
**Iteration4:** Planning to add a search function to main page
